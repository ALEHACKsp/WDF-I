# Driver samples for Writing WDF Drivers I: Core Concepts #
These are the starting samples that we use for exercises during our 5-day lecture and lab:

The focus of these samples is simplicity. For a lab environment, we strive to provide stripped down samples that provide the minimum amount of functionality possible. They are strictly meant as a learning exercise and do not necessarily represent best practices for production code.

You will find detailed instructions for the lab exercises in the [lab exercise handout](https://github.com/OSRDrivers/WDF-I/blob/master/Docs_and_Misc/WDF%20Lab%20Exercises.pdf) that is in the \Docs_and_Misc directory of this repo.
